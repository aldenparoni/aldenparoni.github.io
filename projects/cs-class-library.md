## Overview
The summer of 2024 marked my second summer internship with Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART), a semi-autonomous department of the City and County of Honolulu tasked with overseeing the construction and completion of the Honolulu rail project, now called Skyline. My first summer internship with HART was the year before, in 2023, where I worked on a project to build a business process workflow within Oracle Primavera Unifier to streamline the processes of compiling punch list items, vetting them, and overseeing their completion. Oracle Primavera Unifier, or simply Unifier, is a cloud-based project management software that HART uses to manage the construction of Skyline. The process of building the business process workflow in Unifier had little to do with my skill set as a computer science student, but it was a great learning experience in understanding how project management software works and how it can be customized to fit the needs of a project. 

However, as I was learning the ins and outs of Unifier, I learned there was a way to automate record creation using web services. People who have worked for HART in the past built Python modules that leveraged Unifier's REST API to do things like create, update, and find records, download and upload attachments, as well as systems administration tasks like updating user permissions. 

After the summer 2023 internship program, I stuck around to work part-time as I returned to school up until the next summer internship in 2024.

I cloned the most recent state of the project from Bitbucket to my personal GitHub. You can [view the repo here](https://github.com/aldenparoni/unifier-rest-class-library).
