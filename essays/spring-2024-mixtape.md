Two semesters ago, when I took ICS 314, I approached the final exam essay with the idea of using my Spotify as a means to showcase what I had learned throughout the semester. As I mentioned before in that essay, at the beginning of every semester I create a new playlist with initially zero songs. Over time, I add songs to the playlist that are either connected to a significant memory or are simply enjoyable. By the end of finals week, I would have created a little time capsule for myself to reflect and reminisce on the last 17 or 18 weeks. Each semester seems to rush on quicker than the last; to already be so close to the finish line of Spring 2024 is startling. Just as I did with ICS 314, I plan to clearly describe my experience in ICS 414 through the lens of [this semester's Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0sXG4xCugakEbUZtkwqiaG?si=b6e7a1e741634bed).

_"Do you think I have forgotten about you?"_

Going in, I was actually a bit worried about having waited a semester after 314 to take 414. I hadn't worked on anything with Meteor or React since taking 314, so I was scared that I put myself behind. Over winter break, I retook the freeCodeCamp courses on JavaScript and ES6 to refresh my memory. I prepared as much as I could for this class. 

Upon learning that I would be working in a group for the entire semester, my worries then shifted to my role in the team. Where would I fit? How would I contribute? On the first day of class, when we settled into our groups, I made it clear that it had been a while since I took 314. I remember we went around the table asking what each of us were good at, and I half-jokingly responded, "I just work hard".
